# Wheat Head Detection

This project detects wheat heads in field images using YOLO. I trained a YOLO11 model on labeled wheat images so it can find and draw boxes around wheat heads in photos.

The project is inspired by the [Global Wheat Detection competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/global-wheat-detection). This is a university assignment - the code is vibe coded, just experimenting and learning concepts, not production-ready.
